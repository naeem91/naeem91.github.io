## Installing and using Hugo
Hugo is a static site generator tool built with the Go language.
I was just reading some random blog and at the bottom of their page found `built with Hugo` thing. After checking it I decided to give it a try, not knowing that I already have a gh pages hosted blog using Jekyll, which I never used after the first time.

Here's how to use Hugo to generate a static site and then host it on Github pages:

## Usage

Installation is pretty straightforward:

On Mac:
```
brew install hugo
```
After installing it, you [create a site](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-2-create-a-new-site), author pages, posts and other type of content using the [markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

On your local machine, you can run the hugo server to see how the site looks in the browser.
That's pretty much all about the installation and basic usage.

## Hosting on Github Pages
